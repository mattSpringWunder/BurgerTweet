Firstly, this is built ontop of an awesome API built by ZacharySpielberger over at the https://fullstack.network and can be seen here: 
https://thefullstack.network/u/ZacharySpielberger/project/bob-s-burgers-api

This Repo is for a Bot which posts every 5 seconds a new fact or trivia question about the show Bobs burgers to Twitter.

As mentioned above, this bot, will read from ZacharySpielberger API and then make a post to Twitter.

For some context, I'm a Frontend guy and I wanted to play around with Java and the Twitter SDK / API, so the code isn't complete nor is it clean / performant
